# Project: python-escapade
# Package: sorting-algorithms
#
# Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. 
# This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if 
# they are not in order. 
# This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the number of items.
#
# Algorithm:
# ----------
#
# We assume list is an array of n elements. We further assume that swap function swaps the values of the given array elements.
#
# begin BubbleSort(list)
#
#   for all elements of list
#      if list[i] > list[i+1]
#         swap(list[i], list[i+1])
#      end if
#   end for
#   
#   return list
#   
# end BubbleSort
#
# Pseudocode:
# ----------
#
#   Bubblesort is an elementary sorting algorithm. The idea is to imagine bubbling the smallest elements of a (vertical) array to the
#   top; then bubble the next smallest; then so on until the entire array is sorted. Bubble sort is worse than both insertion sort and
#   selection sort. It moves elements as many times as insertion sort (bad) and it takes as long as selection sort (bad). On the positive
#   side, bubble sort is easy to understand. Also there are highly improved variants of bubble sort.
#
#  0] For each element at index i from n to 0, loop:
#  1] For each element at index j, from n to i exclusive, loop:
#  2] If the element at j is less than that at j+1, swap them.
