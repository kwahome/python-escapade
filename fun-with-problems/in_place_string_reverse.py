# Title: Reversing a string in-place
# Project: python-escapade
# Package: fun-with-problems
#
#
# Write a function to reverse a string in-place 
#
# Since strings in Python are immutable â†´ , first convert the string into a list of characters, do the in-place reversal on that list, and 
# re-join that list into a string before returning it. This isn't technically "in-place" and the list of characters will cost O(n)O(n)O(n) 
# additional space, but it's a reasonable way to stay within the spirit of the challenge. If you're comfortable coding in a language with 
# mutable strings, that'd be even better!

		# swap the front word and back word
		string[left], string[right] = \
			string[right], string[left]
